# Agenda

* Introduction to Impala 
* Components of the Impala Server
* File Format Support in Impala
* Impala SQL Language

# Introduction to Impala

* Open Source Project by Cloudera
    * <https://github.com/cloudera/impala>
* Distributed, Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) engine
* (Real-time) Interactive Query for Hadoop
* Impala uses the same metadata store as Hive to record information about table structure and properties
* Impala server consists of three different daemon processes:
    * impalad 
    * statestored
    * catalogd

# Components of the Impala Server

* impalad (The Impala Daemon) 
    - runs on **each node** of the cluster
    - coordinator node = that node you submit a query
* statestored (The Impala Statestore)
    - run on **one node** in the cluster
    - checks on the **health of Impala daemons**
    - cluster just becomes less robust while statestored is offline
* catalogd (The Impala Catalog Service)
    - run on **one node** in the cluster
    - relays the **metadata changes** to all the nodes
    - reduces **REFRESH** and **INVALIDATE METADATA**

# File Format support in Impala (1)

      <td>Yes. For CREATE TABLE with no STORED AS clause, the default file format is uncompressed text, with values separated by ASCII 0x01 characters (typically represented as Ctrl-A).</td>
      <td>Yes: CREATE TABLE, INSERT, LOAD DATA, and query. If LZO compression is used, you must create the table and load data in Hive.
      If other kinds of compression are used, you must load data through LOAD DATA,
      Hive, or manually in HDFS.

# Impala SQL Language

* It currently doesn’t have OLTP-style operations such as **DELETE , UPDATE , or COMMIT / ROLLBACK**
* It also does not have **indexes, constraints, or foreign keys**
* Impala supports **most of the same statements and clauses as HiveQL**
    * Impala data manipulation (DML) statements is similar to the DML component of HiveQL.
    * Impala provides many **built-in functions** with the **same names and parameter types** as their HiveQL equivalents. 
    * Impala **data types** have the same names and semantics as the equivalent Hive data types
* Impala also supports **INSERT INTO** and **INSERT OVERWRITE**.

# SQL Differences Between Impala and Hive

* Impala does not currently support these HiveQL statements:
    * ANALYZE TABLE (the Impala equivalent is COMPUTE STATS)
    * DESCRIBE COLUMN
    * DESCRIBE DATABASE
    * EXPORT TABLE
    * IMPORT TABLE
    * SHOW TABLE EXTENDED
    * SHOW INDEXES
    * SHOW COLUMNS
